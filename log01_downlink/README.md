Donwlink on LG01 from TTN
===========================================================

Many people tried to get downlink working to a lora device, communicating
with the LG01 single channel forwarder..  many gave up !

I nearlyâ€¦ but got it to run finally. There are a number of places and aspects
to consider and  where this breaks down and adjustments had to be made.

The document describes the learning and steps and getting it to work.
The files have been added for reference and maybe usage
